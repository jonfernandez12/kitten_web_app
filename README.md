# Kitten Social Media

A small web application as a PoC for [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) 
(A [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework). 

We used Google Firebase as a database and deployment tool, 
please redirect to the following URL to access:

The purpose of this application was learn how to handle 
different threads on an application 
deployed in the cloud. In this case, users can like posts
of kittens in parallel and their like will be handled by the application,
which will handle the priorities.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
