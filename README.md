# Kitten Social Media

A small web application as a PoC for [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) 
(A [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework). 

We used Google Firebase as a database and deployment tool,

The purpose of this application was learn how to handle 
different threads (users doing actions) on an application 
deployed in the cloud.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
